# EFFORT_DISCOUNTING
Code for running computational models of cooperative and competitive social effort discounting.
This project was completed as part of my postdoctoral fellowship at the Wharton Neuroscience Initiative and the Wharton School, UPenn. I worked under Dr Michael Platt.
It is a direct extension of my PhD work, which was focused on social effort discounting (how we make decisions about expending our own effort (costs) on behalf of others.
