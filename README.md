# EFFORT_DISCOUNTING
Code for running computational models of cooperative and competitive social effort discounting.

This repo contains scripts for preprocessing, model definition, parameter estimation, model comparison, and main. It also contains a model debugging script, and a model-free analytics script (hierarchnical regression analysis).

This project was completed as part of my postdoctoral fellowship at the Wharton Neuroscience Initiative and the Wharton School, UPenn. I worked under Dr Michael Platt.
It is an indirect extension of my PhD work, which was focused on social effort discounting (how we make decisions about expending our own effort (costs) on behalf of others.
